## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

The director of marketing and your manager Lily Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
I will figure this out by analysing the 12 months of cyclistic's bike usage data from  jan 2022 to dec 2022.  Check out the Bike Share Analysis.Rmd file for my analysis.
The data used for the project is from jan 2022 to dec 2022.
