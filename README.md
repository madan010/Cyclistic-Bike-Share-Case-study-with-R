## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

The director of marketing and your manager Lily Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer:

# Top 3 Recommendation Based on My Analysis
> ###  Focus on acquiring more casual riders
- The data shows that casual riders take longer rides than members on average. This is a valuable opportunity for the business, as longer rides mean more revenue. The business can focus on acquiring more casual riders
> ### People are more likely to ride bikes for leisure on weekends.
- offering discounts on bike-sharing rides on weekends, the company can encourage more people to use the service
> ### Retaining the members and acquaring more casual riders.
-  the company could offer commuting passes to members so that they members use the services for longer, and they could offer discounts on weekend rides to attract more casual riders.
